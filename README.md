# Flappy-Bird-Game

- Developed a Flappy Bird "cloned" game in Java Swing, to simulate gravity and velocity of Flappy Bird and its movements alongside the pipes within the game
- Implemented obstacle generation with randomized locations to simulate the actual Flappy Bird game flying through pipes to score points to go alongside the dynamic scoring system with high-score displayed
- Created a game loop with timers within Java Swing to handle real time rendering of the pipes and controls to "fly" Flappy Bird across the map
- Showcases knowledge with physics, game and content generation, and real time game developing and processing

## Features
- **Physics included gameplay** with gravity implemented and jump velocity for Flappy Bird
- **Procedural generation** of pipes in randomized locations throughout the game with gaps
- **Dynamic scoring system** with high score implemented
- Smooth **controls** (Spacebar to "jump" or flap) for Flappy Bird
- Restartable after game over (using Spacebar to restart)

## üõ†Ô∏è Programming/Languages used
- **Java**
- **Swing / AWT** for graphics and input of the game
- **Timers** for real-time rendering and game loop

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Compile and Run the FlappyBird.java file utilzing the App.java

## How to Play
- Pressing spacebar "flaps" the wings of Flappy Bird
- Avoid the pipes by flapping your way through the gaps of the pipes to gain 1 point to your score
- Game ends when you collide or hit a pipe with Flappy Bird or if you fall off the screen of the game
- High score and Score is displayed at the top left of the screen
