# Flappy-Bird-Game

- Developed a Flappy Bird "cloned" game in Java Swing, to simulate gravity and velocity of Flappy Bird and its movements alongside the pipes within the game
- Implemented obstacle generation with randomized locations to simulate the actual Flappy Bird game flying through pipes to score points to go alongside the dynamic scoring system with high-score displayed
- Created a game loop with timers within Java Swing to handle real time rendering of the pipes and controls to "fly" Flappy Bird across the map
- Showcases knowledge with physics, game and content generation, and real time game developing and processing
